D. EXECUTING THE PROJECT
-----
### Project Design

#### Flowchart

### Project Coding
#### Import Library
![lib](Assets/import_library.png)

First and foremost, we imported the required python library. The library required for this system is OpenCV. [installation of OpenCV](https://github.com/lawlipyang/AIPM_S2G1_GrpF/tree/main/src#requirements)


#### Setting up capture device
![cap_device](Assets/cap_device_setting.png)

Next, we setting up the capture device we are going to use. We also manage the device to capture in the size that we decided. 


#### Read the list of labels
![label_list](Assets/read_label_list.png)

To allow the system label the object detected, we have a list of labels which is [coco.names](../src). The system will read the file and convert it into a class with ids and labels.


#### Setting up the DNN model
![dnn_model](Assets/dnn_model_setting.png)

Furthermore, we use the module (dnn.DetectionModel) build in the OpenCV, which is used for object detection, as the model of this system. We has set up the Deep Neural Network model using the [weights](../src) and [configurations](../src). There is also some parameters that is set to the model.


#### Detect the object

Finally, the system will show the output of detection. The object that is successfully detected will be surrrounded by a green rectangle and the label will show on the top-left of the rectangle.
