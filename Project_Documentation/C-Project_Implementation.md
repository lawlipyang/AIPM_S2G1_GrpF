# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT

### Deliverables

Hardware Requirement: Hardware Requirement: For the hardware, our group use our own laptop to develop the system with different specification.

#### Software Requirement:

For the software, our group used python programming language to implement the code for intelligent module in recognizing object, MobileNets a computer vision models for TensorFlow and PHP programming language to design the interface in the website and database connection.

#### Intelligent System Architecture:

For this system, it use the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN or ConvNet) and Deep Neural Network (DNN). This both methods is a class of neural networks which is used to do object detection. It contain multiple layers between the input and output layers.
