# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## C. IMPLEMENTING THE PROJECT

### Deliverables

Hardware Requirement: Hardware Requirement: For the hardware, our group uses using a private laptop to develop the system with different spesification.

#### Software Requirement:

For the software, our group used python programming language to implement the code for intelligent module in recognizing object and PHP programming language to design the interface in the website and database connection.

#### Intelligent System Architecture:

For this system, it use th Convolutional Neural Network(CNN or ConvNet). It is a class of deep neural networks which is used to do object detection. There are three layers in a CNN: a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and a fully connected layer.
