### Risk Identification Chart


| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (Poor attitude toward quality; substandard design, materials, and workmanship; inadequate quality assurance program)|1. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The system cannot recognize the item correctly because of the noise containing in the Image or the sensor that are blurry. It caused the system confused to detect the object. <br><br> 2. Inadequate Quality Assurance Program: The quality of the AI model cannot recognize the new object.|How: The Image cannot be detect Based on the pattern or features of the item <br> <br> When: It Happen during training model|Improve camera sensor or remove noise containing in the image.|
|Cost <br> (Estimating errors; inadequate productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|1. Contigency: The costing of the maintance will be spiked if there is a failure or the system cannot function properly. <br><br> 2. Inadequate productivity: Team members face problems in completing their tasks that have been set for them and  it can lead to extra cost need to be allocated |How: when to doing the maintenance the system, the unexpected extra charged will be happen.<br><br>When: The problem most probably will be encountered during the project execution and project implementation.|Notify the owner through email whenever budget exceed threshold in the service of the system.
|Time <br> (Errors in estimating time or resource availability; errors in determining the critical path; poor allocation and management of float; early release of competitive products) | 1. The project was unable to meet the milestones specified in the Gantt Chart. <br><br> 2. Erros in estimating resource availability: There are insufficient servers to run the object recognition model training. |How: It happens when one of the group members has a problem in developing a project or does not follow the set milestone. <br><br> When: During the project execution and monitoring phase, the issue will arise.| The project manager need to monitor the progress of each group member and identify if there are group members who are facing problems in developing the project.|
