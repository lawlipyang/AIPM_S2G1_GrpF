#### 3. Final Report

##### OBJECT DETECTION SYSTEM

##### 1.0 PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The object detection system done by Ai Tech was intended to develop an artificial intelligence system that is able to detect grocery when doing payment at the caunter in the Lotus mall. Besides, one of the aims of Ai Tech is to develop a system that is able to recognize items.In addition, we want to create an API that may be used as an integration module in the future for convenience.

##### 2.0 SUMMARY OF PROJECT RESULTS

After the system has been completed, we tested the accuracy of the system. The system is 50%

##### 3.0 ORIGINAL AND ACTUAL SCHEDULE

The project member sticks to the Gantt chart scheduled so, the actual progress fits the original schedule

#####  5.0  PROJECT ASSESSMENT

#####  5.1  SCOPE

#####  5.2  OBJECTIVES

Ai Tech. managed to achieve the objectives initialized since the beginning of the project. A system that is artificial intelligence powered, which uses Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) has been made. Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is a class of deep neural networks which is mostly used to do object detection. By using this method, our objective of building the object detection was success. 

#####  5.3  IMPACTS

By creating this system, the time needed of queuing up in front of the payment counter before checking out from the mall has been reduced. People do not have to waste time in long queues during the payment process. The payment process will be easier. users only need to scan the item and make a cashless payment.

#####  6.0  TRANSITION PLAN

Ai Tech. staff will provide support when require. The main work of support provided by Ai Tech. staff on the object detection system project are as shown below:

i) Maintain the system

ii) Handling errors and updates of the system

iii) Provide user guidelines for Lotus staff to use the system

iv) Report information to senior management on monthly basis
